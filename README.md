# Image-Classification

In this project, I build a model to identity the type of ball.

I used the dataset from Kaggle-"Balls - Image Classification". The dataset contains mages of various types of balls. There are 24 different types (classes) . train set includes 2860 files in 24 subdirectories. I started the project by loading the Dataset from Kaggle, reading and reveiwing the dataset using pandas,numpy,matplotlib,PIL,os and cv2 libraries. After that i created the data generators, build the model , trained the model(compile,fit).
